# string-tools

`string-tools` is a practical companion library for `racket/string`.
It provides additional string and character-set utilities with consistent
index handling (including negative indices and clamped bounds), plus
helpers for searching, trimming, slicing, tokenizing, escaping, layout,
and similarity.
